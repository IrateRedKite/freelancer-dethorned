The contents of Freelancer's SCRIPTS and MISSIONS folders decoded to lua using [Dethorn by Jason Hood](http://adoxa.altervista.org/freelancer/tools.html#dethorn).  
Contains files from the release version of the game as well as the 2002 multiplayer beta build that can be [found on The Starport.](https://the-starport.net/freelancer/download/singlefile.php?cid=11&lid=2678)  

None of the release or beta files here have been modified from vanilla after decoding, **and have all their original errors**. Files have been decoded using the 1.01 version of Dethorn, released on 2023-05-04. If you're looking for fixed and fully functional versions of the game's thorn files, I'd take a look at [Jason's Freelancer Patch](http://adoxa.altervista.org/freelancer/dl.php?f=jflp) and [Freelancer HD Edition](https://github.com/BC46/freelancer-hd-edition)!
